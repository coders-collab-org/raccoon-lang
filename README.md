# Raccoon Language

Raccoon is a high-level programming language designed for safe, efficient, and productive development.
It has a syntax inspired by Rust, but with a more approachable learning curve, similar to JavaScript or Python.
Raccoon uses static types, but does not expose low-level features such as pointers, making it a good choice for web development, scripting, or systems programming.

## Getting started

This repository contains the source code for Raccoon, but there is no compiler or interpreter yet.
If you want to help develop Raccoon, you can start by reading the [language specification](./docs/spec.md) and the [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
You can also check the [issues](https://github.com/coders-collab-org/raccoon-lang/issues) to see what needs to be done.
